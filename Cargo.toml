# The dependencies below are not really direct dependencies. They are just a
# way of pinning certain crates to certain versions to ensure we stay true to
# this project's MSRV. I know there is Cargo.lock to lock versions down, but
# pinning them here also guarantees that a `cargo update` will not update them
# to a newer version. Cargo.lock does not do that.
