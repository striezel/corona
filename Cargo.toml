# The dependencies below are not really direct dependencies. They are just a
# way of pinning certain crates to certain versions to ensure we stay true to
# this project's MSRV. I know there is Cargo.lock to lock versions down, but
# pinning them here also guarantees that a `cargo update` will not update them
# to a newer version. Cargo.lock does not do that.

# Pin hashlink to 0.8.1, because later versions depend on hashbrown 0.14 which
# needs rustc 1.65, but our MSRV is 1.63.0. It also avoids some crate
# duplication.
