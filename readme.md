# Coronavirus case numbers per country

This repository contains a few PHP scripts that can generate graphs showing the
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) case numbers for various countries.

It is still in an early stage of development and very simplistic. And so are the
generated graphs.

See the <https://striezel.github.io/corona/> for a snapshot of those graphs.
